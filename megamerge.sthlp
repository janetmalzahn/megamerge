{title:megamerge}

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:megamerge} performs up to 16 merges sequentially to exhaustively link data with names and additional variables.

{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:megamerge} performs sequential 1:1 merges in decreasing orders of specificity to match record with names. {bf:megamerge} requires that both master and using data have the variables first, last, middle, and suffix.

{p 4 4 2}
Each merge is in decreasing levels of specificity, so observations are matched on the most information avaiable. Since the merges are 1:1, observations that are not unique merge variables in the master and the using are omitted at each merge but appended to the ummatched data for the next merge. 


{title:Options}

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:trywithout({it:var})} runs one iteration of the merge without the specificed variable. The variable given the this option must be contained in the varlist given originally to megamerge. 

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:messy} specifies that all variables created by megamerge (and all from using not of interest) be kept. By default, megamerge keeps the variables originally in master and using.

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:keepmerges({it:mergecodes})} specifies that only merges corresponding to {it:merge_codes} be run. This option supercedes omitmerges().

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:omitmerges({it:mergecode})} specifies that merges corresponding to the {it:merge_codes} (detailed below) be skipped.

{p 4 4 2}
{bf:mergetype({it:mergetype})} specifies whether megamerge should implement a m:1 (duplicates in the master) or a 1:m (duplicates in the using) merge instead of the 1:1 default.

{title:Process}

{p 4 4 2}
Each phase of megamerge consists of the following steps
{break}    1. Specify list of variables to be used in the merge
{break}    2. Append previously omitted duplicates from master and using to unmatched observations from master and using respectively.
{break}    3. Generate new variables for certain merges
{break}    4. Save and separte duplicate obsevations from master and using in a separate dataset.
{break}    5. Perform a 1:1 merge of master to using on the variable list for that merge
{break}    6. Append matched observations with a merge_code to indicate which merge a match came from to prior matched observations.
{break}    7. Separate out observations that were not matched from master and using for use in the next merge.


{title:Remarks}

{p 4 4 2}
The "m:1" and "1:m" merge options allow for duplicate observations, however, observations are only grouped together as duplicates if they match on last, first, middle, suffix, and all provided merge variables. Observations that would be considered duplicates for later stage merges (say, on first, last, and merge variables) but differ on other relevant variables (say different middles) would not be considered separate observations from the perspective of megamerge.




{title:Example(s)}

    performs a megamerge of data in memory to data2 on name vars, state, and dist to get pop

        . megamerge state dist using data2

    performs same megamerge, but tries a round without the district variable

        . megamerge state dist using data2, trywithout(dist)
		
    performs same megamerge, but only on last name and on last and initial

        . megamerge state dist using data2, trywithout(dist) keepmerges(7 14)
		
    performs same megamerge, but without a merge on nicknames

        . megamerge state dist using data2, trywithout(dist) omitmerge(8)
		
{p 4 4 2}
	performs same megamerge, but keeps all intermediate variables

        . megamerge state dist using data2, trywithout(dist) messy
